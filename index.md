introduction: |
  This is my personal blog where you gonna see me talk about a plethora of random stuffs --- data, coding, travel, book/movie reviews and whatnot. While you may find some ingenious and interesting things laying around, most of the content are **nonsensical ramblings**, so take them with a kilogram (or roughly 2.2 lbs for my American non-SI heathens) of salt:

  - Clean responsive design with six customizable skins
  - Curriculum Vit√¶/Resume layout powered by [JSON data](http://registry.jsonresume.org/)
  - About page layout
  - Disqus Comments and Google Analytics support
  - SEO best practices via [Jekyll SEO Tag](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag/)
