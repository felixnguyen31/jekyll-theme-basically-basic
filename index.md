introduction: |
  This is my personal blog where you gonna see me talk about a plethora of random stuffs --- data, coding, travel, book/movie reviews and whatnot. While you may find some ingenious and interesting things laying around, most of the content are **nonsensical ramblings**, so take them with a kilogram (or roughly 2.2 lbs for my American non-SI heathens) of salt.
