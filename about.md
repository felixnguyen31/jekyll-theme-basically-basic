This is my personal blog where I'm gonna talk about a plethora of random stuffs --- _data, coding, travel, book/movie reviews_ and whatnot. While you may find some ingenious and interesting things laying around, most of the content are **nonsensical ramblings**, so take them with a kilogram of salt (or roughly _2.2 lbs_ for my American non-SI heathens).
