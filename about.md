Howdy, stranger! Welcome to **Basically Nerd**. This is my personal blog --- Where I can ramble on about (maybe) useless stuffs. Conventions and features found there are fully supported by **Basically Basic**, with a few enhancements thrown in for good measure:

- Clean responsive design with [six customizable skins](#skin)
- Curriculum Vit√¶/Resume layout powered by [JSON data](http://registry.jsonresume.org/)
- About page layout
- Disqus Comments and Google Analytics support
- SEO best practices via [Jekyll SEO Tag](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag/)
