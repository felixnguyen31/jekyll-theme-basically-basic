When the first Iron Man came out in 2008, the idea of an omni potent, ever-present Artificial Intelligence assistant like the J.A.R.V.I.S seemed like a cool but far-fetched science fiction concept. A decade later, the fiction has become the reality. All of the technologies that power J.A.R.V.I.S are either currently in development or already available—and being rapidly refined (save for the Hologram projection, but there are hopes on that as well). Amazon, Google, Baidu, and recently Facebook, have launched AI platforms with increasingly skilled digital assistants. While none have yet reached J.A.R.V.I.S level of abilities, and “awesomeness”, that is apparently their goal—and it’s just a matter of time before they get there.

Not only the capabilities, but the popularity of AI assistants is on the rise as well. Analysts estimate that Amazon, for instance, has sold some 25 million Echo smart speakers, which people use to engage with its AI assistant, Alexa, and that number is expected to more than double by 2020. This is unaccounted for tens of millions of other devices that we can also use to access Alexa. Similarly, Google Assistant is estimated to be available on more than 400 millions devices. The popularity of AI assistant is predicted to increase even more in the future. So, how will this change affect marketing?

## SHIFTING CUSTOMER LOYALTY

The first thing would be affected by the rise of Artificial Intelligent Assistants is customer loyalty, specifically who the customers are loyal to. Brands today owe much of their success to their ability to signal quality and win buyers’ loyalty. But in a world of ubiquitous AI platforms, marketers may find that consumers shift their allegiance from trusted brands to a trusted AI assistant. The activities that help brands build up relationships with buyers over time - understanding and fulfilling people’s needs, assuring quality, and consistently putting consumers’ interests at the center - will in many cases be performed by the AI. Professor Niraj Dawar at Ivey Business School predicts that AI assistants will win consumers’ trust and loyalty better than any previous marketing technology. Therefore focus of many brands should be shifted from reinforcing direct relationships with consumers to optimizing their positions on AI platforms. This new indirect relationship would lead to the next implication on customer acquisition.

## THE SCIENCE OF CUSTOMER ACQUISITION THROUGH THE MACHINES
 
 With the availability of big data, customer acquisition has become more efficient than ever before. However, while the human is still a part of the equation, there is a certain limit to the accuracy. Customers have limit cognition abilities: they need to watch an ad multiple times to remember it, and even if they can remember, most tends to selectively recall the parts that are most interesting to them, which is not necessarily related to the brand itself. In an AI world, however, these human factors would be less of a challenge than today, as the main target of billions in annual spending on brand marketing shifts from forgetful, biased consumers to AI platforms that retain every last bit of information.
 
The AI platform’s job would be analyzing data, considering product pricing, past performance, review, categories… as well as customer preferences and past behaviors. The customer acquisition process would become more of a science, on how to influence AI assistants’ algorithms, rather than an art. In this matter, it is quite similar to how digital ad exchange platforms transformed digital advertising to an algorithmic-based science. In the future, it will be crucial for companies to understand the customized purchasing criteria that the AI applies on behalf of each consumer.

## A NEW WAY OF GETTING CUSTOMER INSIGHTS

Imagine a world where reliable satisfaction data is easier to get from AI platforms than from consumers themselves. That is a world that we are heading into, if current trends continue. A platform serves consumers by constantly anticipating their needs. It collects granular data on their purchasing patterns and product use and try to understand their goals: Do they want food products to improve their health or they value taste and price more? Do they prefer aesthetic or durability? More sophisticated AI could even go further and figure out the trade-offs consumers are willing to make, their current moods, their temporal patterns… With AI assistants, marketers now have a constant vigilant eye on their customers, like a permanent ethnographic research, keep churning out new results on a second basic.

This reality will force marketers to move away for the traditional long-term research model to a more agile and programmatic one, constantly updating their measurements and adapting their tools to real-time data stream from AI platforms. For example, instead of a traditional fixed survey, market researchers could create an interactive survey through voice assistant where the question content change in accordance with customer’s mood perceived by the AI, and a more adaptive language that can change as conversation progress.
