14 years ago, a newlywed developer named **Shay Banon** moved to London to help his lovely wife realize her dream of becoming a chef. As any unemployed developer with too much time in hand would do, he decided to play around with this trending tech of the time called **"Lucene"**, and built an app for his wife to capture all the cooking knowledge she was gathering during her chef lessons. From that simple side project, **ElasticSearch** was born. Now comprises of three different products and plenty of other extensions and add-ons, Elastic stack has been adopted by a wide variety of firms (from Goldman Sachs to Accenture) as a flexible and scalable analytics platform. So, what the hell is Elastic? Below is a brief definition:

>The **ELK Stack** is a collection of three open-source products — Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana — from Elastic. **Elasticsearch** is a NoSQL database that is based on the Lucene search engine. **Logstash** is a log pipeline tool that accepts inputs from various sources, executes different transformations, and exports the data to various targets. Kibana is a visualization layer that works on top of Elasticsearch.[^1]

You can read more about Elastic stack from their very comprehensive guide [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html). Elastic stack can work out-of-the-box, and the setup time is under one hour and relatively easy and straight-forward for beginner, so you only need a free weekend to get a general feel of its features and advantages. In the rest of this article, I will point out a few of the reasons why Elastic is a fitting tool for Marketing Analytics, and an use case tutorial may be up in the near future.
